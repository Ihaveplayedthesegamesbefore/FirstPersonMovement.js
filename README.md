This code is applicable to only the "Playcanvas" Game engine.
Features->
-Fps movement
-Jumping
-Crouching 'c'
-Pickup mode 'number 1' (Ensure to press this to actually pick up stuff)
-Pickup/drop 'RMB'
-Throw 'Rmb' (while object is picked up)
-Push 'F'
-sprint 'shift'
Also make sure to attach the pickubable.js to any object in the scene to make interaction possible
**NOTE**: I will not completely take credit in making this, though it took me weeks to perfect this (There is still a bug that makes you fly while holding an object too close :^>) I used Ai to make the code, It is a sad reality but bare with me as I'm still in highschool at this moment learning gamedev solo.
Thanks,

p.s you can also rotate picked up objects by holding R and moving your mouse! :)
